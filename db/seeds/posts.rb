Cats are trapped humanely, taken to the vet, neutered, and after a period of recuperation released back into their home territory.<div><br></div><div>Colonies of cats whether in back gardens, farms, building sites, or industrial areas, can breed so rapidly that even rabbits blink. Our aim is to stop this proliferation of unwanted kittens who live short and miserable lives and whose mothers breed and breed until they are worn out and wretched.<br></div><div><br></div><div>A pair of breeding cats can, in their lifetimes, produce <i>20,000 descendants</i> (yes twenty thousand!!).<br></div><div><br></div><div>This is a new website so please bear with us while we set everything up.</div>", :summary => "We're live!
